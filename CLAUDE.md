How to work with me:
1) Don't assume anything. Always check logs. If logs aren't there, update the code to generate logs to be able to answer your doubts and only then decide what to do.
2) If you are unsure of a direction to take, or a decision to make, ask me. I'll help you make that decision.w


TO DO:

1) Create a website for Mathematricks (a hedge fund). To better understand mathematricks use @sales_deck.md.
2) Create a url for a webhook: brief is in @webhook_brief.md
3) once the frontend is ready, deploy it to GCP for me.
4) help me setup the emails as well. I want emails to work for free.
