Slide 3: Our Edge

(merging slides 3,4,5 from before)

Talent moat: proprietary global network of quant researchers → continuous inflow of new strategies.

Proprietary allocation algo: dynamically allocates across strategies based on metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, correlation, volatility, liquidity).

Result: smoothed equity curve + superior risk-adjusted returns.
